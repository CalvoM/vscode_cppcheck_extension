1.Motivation
Suppose to do cppcheck for C++ source code file.
But there's no official visual studio code extenstion for cppcheck.
And I found there's only one available extension for this, which integrate other two lints for c++.
While it crashes on my visual studio code.
Since it still depends on the executable file of cppcheck after the tool installation. 
I guess the only thing I need to to is launch cppcheck instance when I try to do cppcheck.
And render the result in a human readable way on vscode.

2. preparations
1)cppcheck can ouput the report file with xml file.
2)and it's easy to parse the xml file to get the locations of suspicious code.
think about how to show the result on vscode next
